How it looks like: word.index(e)
How it should be: word.index("e")

How it looks like: vecs = np.vstack([word.vector for word in vocab if word.has_vector])
How it should be: vecs = np.vstack([word.vector for word in vocab if word.has_vector])



## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_subwords_wiki_lg"
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists and machine learners who want to excel in NLP as well as NLP developers who want to master spaCy and build applications with it. Language and speech professionals who want to get hands-on with Python and spaCy and software developers who want to quickly prototype applications with spaCy will also find this book helpful. Beginner-level knowledge of the Python programming language is required to get the most out of this book.
